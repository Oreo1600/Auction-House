## Auction House (Out of Commission)
An economy based game bot.

#Basics

You can create various cards of different categories. The card can be about any existing entity in this world.
You can earn 500ðŸª™ by creating a card. After your card has been created, it will be evaluated by other people and given an average rarity of user responses.
Then, Your card will be auctioned and a owner will be the one who has highest bid in the auction.

#Auction House

The auction house is a server that is chosen for an auction for a particular card. The auction house is chosen at random. You can turn off the auction house for your server from server settings.

Note: If your server is private and you don't want anyone to join your server, Make sure you disable the auction house from /server_settings command.

#Money Pool

Money pool is a global pool which resets every 3 days. Everyone has a payout rate, that percentage of cash can be withdrawn from pool at any time. Once a pool resets your payout rate also resets. Payout rate increases 0.5% every hour; it can be increased further by creating or rating cards.
Creating a card increases your payout rate by 0.2% and rating a card increases your payout rate by 0.05%.

Enjoy the Auction House!
